### **What Is It?**
This is where all the Witch's scripts live! One easy script, no hassel. The Witch Dock is a handy floating, customizable dock UI that is designed to make your life a little easier, and fit your work style. 

The tool will see more toolkits and features added over time.

🔗 Install:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knight-Witch/KnightWitch.Heroforge/Witch_Scripts/Witch_Dock.user.js

* To set up, simply follow the install link

* Updates are automatic
* Remove from your scripts any time at no risk
* Built to be compatable with r/HeroforgeJSON's scripts (I use them too)
* IF you download the file directly, simply drag & drop the file onto Tampermonkey to install (do not try to open the file on your computer—it will not work!)
* Be sure to read the directions if you see anything written at the bottom of a tool section. Some tools require you to pose an item before the tool can properly work. This is due to how Heroforge operates.
