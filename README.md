# Script Tools For Heroforge

A growing suite of advanced HeroForge userscripts focused on power-user workflows, body editing, kitbashing, decals, booth control, and more.

## **REQUIRED**

### **Witch Dock**
This is where all the Witch's scripts live! One easy script, no hassel. The floating, customizable dock UI is designed to make your life a little easier, and fit your needs. 
The tool will see more toolkits and features added over time.

* To set up, simply follow the install link
* Updates are automatic
* IF you download the file directly, simply drag & drop the file onto Tampermonkey to install (do not try to open the file on your computer—it will not work!)
* Be sure to read the directions if you see anything written at the bottom of a tool section. Some tools require you to pose an item before the tool can properly work. This is due to how Heroforge operates.

This script and all its tools are developed by me, however I will be opening up collaboration to help stabilize some existing scripts with other creators and help grow a nice community tool for us all to use.

Please know this is done in my spare time, and I am not paid for this. It's VERY time consuming, but your support enables me to spend more time helping improve your experience and implement tools you want!
