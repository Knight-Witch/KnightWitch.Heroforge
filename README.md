# Script Tools For Heroforge

A growing suite of advanced HeroForge userscripts focused on power-user workflows, body editing, kitbashing, decals, booth control, and more.

---

## **REQUIRED**

### **Witch Dock (Required Core)**
Several Knight Witch tools dock into this shared floating UI. The Witch Dock UI tool does nothing on its own, but will populate with the below script tools when you install those. The intent is to enable you to pick and choose what you want. This UI is a floating tool you can drag & drop anywhere on your browser, minimize, hide and resize to help keep your workspace organized.

👉 Install:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knight-Witch/KnightWitch.Heroforge/main/Witch_Dock.user.js

## **Scripts Requiring Witch Dock**
All tools requiring Witch Dock are listed here - without Witch Dock, these tools will not function on their own. You do NOT have to install all the below tools and are free to choose which ones you want, but you MUST have Witch Dock for these to work.

### **Body Editor**
Advanced body manipulation tools for syncing proportions, multiple arms, mirrored body parts, and precision editing.

👉 Install:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knight-Witch/KnightWitch.Heroforge/main/Body_Editor.user.js

---

## **Scripts That DO NOT Require Witch Dock**
Some scripts are independant of Witch Dock and can be installed as standalone tools.

### **HF JSON Bulk Download**
A tool to import your entire library as JSONs into a .Zip folder, and download to your computer. This is designed to help you backup your library and work!

👉 Install:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knight-Witch/KnightWitch.Heroforge/main/HF_JSON_Bulk_Download.user.js
